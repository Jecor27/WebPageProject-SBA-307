This website was about adopting a specific breed named Australian Shepherds from a farm where they are raised from. This was inspired from my own experience since i currently own 3 Australian Shepherds. I also added 2 links that would lead to 2 mini games called CSS diner and Flexbox froggy incase you are someone who wishes to practice using those games. 

---Self Reflection---
1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier? 
     -Studied more about bootstrap to be able to use its full capabilities, found it challenging to fully utilize bootstrap during this time and to spend most of my time researching the different functions i can apply using bootstrap.  
2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects? 
    -Adding the video/Gif to the page was rather difficult since i wanted it be able to scale down any screen size. The video wouldn't scale down when making the screen smaller. which required me mess with it until it did. 

3. What would you add to or change about your website if given more time? 
    -I would add more animation or functions with working links to make the website feel smoother. 

4. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
    -Deffinitly want to fully utilize and learn about bootstrap or tailwind to incorporate to my future projects.
